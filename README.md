A fun and interactive Tic Tac Toe Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows two players to compete in the classic X vs O game with a simple and user-friendly interface. Developed as part of my SkillCraft Internship, it demonstrates logic building, DOM manipulation, and responsive design.
